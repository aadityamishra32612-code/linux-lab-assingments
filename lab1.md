 # 🐚 Shell Tutorial – File Permissions with `chmod` and `chown`
---


## 🔹 1. Understanding File Permissions in Linux

Each file/directory in Linux has:

* **Owner** → The user who created the file.
* **Group** → A group of users who may share access.
* **Others** → Everyone else.

### Permission Types

* **r** → Read (4 in numeric)
* **w** → Write (2 in numeric)
* **x** → Execute (1 in numeric)

### Permission Layout

Example from `ls -l`:

```
-rwxr-xr--
```
Breakdown:

* `-` → Regular file (`d` = directory, `l` = symlink, etc.)
* `rwx` → Owner has read, write, execute
* `r-x` → Group has read, execute
* `r--` → Others have read only

### output :

---
## 🔹 2. `chmod` – Change File Permissions

### Syntax

```bash
chmod [options] mode filename
``` 

Modes can be set in **numeric (octal)** or **symbolic** form.

---

### (A) Numeric (Octal) Method

Each permission is represented as a number:

* Read = 4
* Write = 2
* Execute = 1

Add them up:

* `7 = rwx`
* `6 = rw-`
* `5 = r-x`
* `4 = r--`
* `0 = ---`

#### Example:

```bash
chmod 777 script.sh
```

Meaning:

* Owner: 7 → `rwx`
* Group: 7 → `r-w-x`
* Others: 7 → `r-w-x`

![Image](<Screenshot from 2025-09-07 22-17-40.png>)

### (B) Symbolic Method  

Use `u` (user/owner), `g` (group), `o` (others), `a` (all).
Operators:

* `+` → Add permission
* `-` → Remove permission
* `=` → Assign exact permission


Modes can be set in **numeric (octal)** or **symbolic** form.

### (C) Recursive Changes

```bash
chmod -R 755 /mydir
```

* `-R` → applies changes recursively to all files/subdirectories.

## 🔹 3. `chown` – Change File Ownership

### Syntax

```bash
chown [options] new_owner:new_group filename
```

### Examples:

```bash
chown ashish.txt         # Change owner to user 'sameer'
chown ashish:dev.txt       # Change owner to 'sameer' and group to 'dev'
chown ashish:dev file.txt            # Change only group to 'dev'
chown -R ashish:dev /project    # Recursive ownership change
```
# **Practice Experiment on `chown`**

### 🔹 1. Create a new user

```bash
sudo useradd -m newuser
```

* `-m` → creates a home directory `/home/newuser`.

---

### 🔹 2. Create a new group

```bash
sudo groupadd newgroup
```

---

### 🔹 3. Add the user to the group

```bash
sudo usermod -aG newgroup newuser
```

* `-aG` → append user to the supplementary group (doesn’t remove existing groups).

---

### 🔹 4. Create a file (as current user, e.g. root or your login user)

```bash
touch testfile.txt
```

Check ownership:

```bash
ls -l testfile.txt
```

Example:

```
-rw-rw-r--1 sameerchoudhary sameerchoudhary 0 Aug 20 18:52 testfile.txt
```

---

### 🔹 5. Assign ownership of the file to `newuser` and `newgroup`

```bash
sudo chown newuser:newgroup testfile.txt
```

---

### 🔹 6. Verify ownership

```bash
ls -l testfile.txt
```

**Output:**

```
-rw-rw-r--1 newuser newgroup 0 Aug 20 18:52 testfile.txt
```
---

✅ **Key Tip**: Use **numeric for quick settings** (e.g., 755, 644) and **symbolic for fine adjustments** (`u+x`, `g-w`).

## 🔹 4. Putting It All Together

### Example Scenario

```bash
touch project.sh
ls -l project.sh
```

Output:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 sameer dev 0 Aug 19 12:00 project.sh
```

Now:

```bash
chmod 700 project.sh       # Only owner has rwx
chmod u+x,g-w project.sh   # Add execute for user, remove write for group
chown root:admin project.sh # Change owner to root and group to admin
```

---

## 🔹 5. Quick Reference Table

| Numeric | Permission | Meaning      |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| 0       | ---        | No access    |
| 1       | --x        | Execute only |
| 2       | -w-        | Write only   |
| 3       | -wx        | Write + Exec |
| 4       | r--        | Read only    |
| 5       | r-x        | Read + Exec  |
| 6       | rw-        | Read + Write |
| 7       | rwx        | Full access  |

### 📌 Q1 what is the difference between chmod and chown?
    ANS=chown-change ownership
         change the owner and group of a file or directory
        
        chmod-change permissions
         changes the permissions for the owner,group, and others
        
### 📌 Q2 how do you check current directory and user?

      ANS = by using the pwd command to check current directory and by using the whoami to check current user.
